    question: "What is the basic building block of a solar farm?",
    options: [
      "String Inverter",
      "Solar Panel Module",
      "Combiner Box",
      "Torque Tube"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "The solar panel module (also called a photovoltaic module) is the basic building block. Multiple modules connect together to form strings and arrays."

  {
    question: "What type of solar cells are typically used in utility-scale solar farms?",
    options: [
      "Thin-film cells",
      "Organic cells",
      "Monocrystalline silicon cells",
      "Dye-sensitized cells"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Monocrystalline silicon cells are preferred for utility-scale projects due to their high efficiency (20-22%) and long-term reliability."

  {
    question: "What connector type is used to link solar panels together in a string?",
    options: [
      "USB-C connectors",
      "Anderson connectors",
      "MC4 connectors",
      "RJ45 connectors"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "MC4 connectors are the industry standard for connecting solar panels. They provide weatherproof, secure connections that can handle high DC voltages."

    question: "What is the main purpose of a single-axis solar tracker?",
    options: [
      "To protect panels from wind",
      "To follow the sun's path and increase energy production",
      "To cool the panels down",
      "To store excess energy"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Single-axis trackers follow the sun from east to west throughout the day, increasing energy production by up to 25% compared to fixed-tilt systems."
  },
  {
    question: "Which company's tracker bearing features a distinctive half-circle (D-shaped) plate?",
    options: [
      "Nextracker",
      "SunPower",
      "Array Technologies",
      "First Solar"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Array Technologies' DuraTrack system features a distinctive semi-circular plate design with the company name embossed vertically."
  },
  {
    question: "What is the primary function of a combiner box in a solar farm?",
    options: [
      "Convert DC to AC power",
      "Store energy in batteries",
      "Combine multiple string outputs and provide protection",
      "Track the sun's position"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Combiner boxes bundle multiple solar panel strings into a single output while providing crucial protection through fuses and surge protection devices (SPDs)."
  },
  {
    question: "What color is typically used for DC positive cables in solar installations?",
    options: [
      "Blue",
      "Green",
      "Black",
      "Red"
    ],
    correct: 3,
    explanation: "Red is the standard color for DC positive (+) cables, while blue or black is used for DC negative (-) cables. Green/yellow is reserved for grounding."
  },
  {
    question: "What does a string inverter do?",
    options: [
      "Combines multiple strings together",
      "Converts DC power from panels to AC power for the grid",
      "Tracks the sun's movement",
      "Protects against lightning"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "String inverters convert the DC (Direct Current) electricity generated by solar panels into AC (Alternating Current) electricity that can be fed into the power grid."
  },
  {
    question: "What type of foundation is commonly used for tracker posts in solar farms?",
    options: [
      "Concrete footings",
      "Helical piles",
      "Driven piles (W-beam posts)",
      "Floating foundations"
    ],
    correct: 2,
    explanation: "Driven pile foundations using W-beam (wide flange) steel posts are common in utility-scale solar farms. They're quick to install and work well in most soil conditions."
  },
  {
    question: "Approximately how much more energy can a tracking system produce compared to a fixed-tilt system?",
    options: [
      "5-10% more",
      "25% more",
      "50% more",
      "100% more"
    ],
    correct: 1,
    explanation: "Single-axis trackers typically produce about 25% more energy than fixed-tilt systems by keeping panels optimally oriented toward the sun throughout the day."
